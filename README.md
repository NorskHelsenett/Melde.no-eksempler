# Melde.no API client examples

This repo contains two example projects which show how to implement clients for the Melde APIs.

- Example.Reporting: Shows how to report an adverse incident
- Example.Dialog: Shows how to handle dialog creation and dialog message send

The APIs are protected by HelseId. This requires a HelseId client definition, which can be established in NHN's self service portal.
